## Description

- This project was made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Node.js.  We were motivated to build this project as a means to test ourselves to create a creative application.  It was built because of the teamwork of four people attempting to improve their collaboration skills.  It is intended to solve the problem of creating a system where users can create accounts and play a text-based adventure game!  In making said project, we learned about teamwork, bootstrap classes, MERN applications/file structure, and Apollo/GraphQL/React syntax.
